In each cycle, the number of cells quadruples and the number of CG
iterations roughly doubles.
Also, in each cycle, the program writes one output graphic file in EPS
format. They are depicted in the following:

Due to the variable coefficient (the curvature there is reduced by the
same factor by which the coefficient is increased), the top region of
the solution is flattened. The gradient of the solution is
discontinuous there, although this is not very clearly visible in the
pictures above. We will look at this in more detail in the next
example.
